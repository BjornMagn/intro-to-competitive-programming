# intro-to-competitive-programming
This repo contains Cache-Flow's notebook for ACM-competitions.

All the code is found in the code/ folder. 

notebook.pdf might not continue to be up to date. I try to only push stable versions of the pdf.

The code is somewhat tested, but I'm planning to include tests in this repo in the future.

Slides for an introduction to competitive programming are avaliable here:
